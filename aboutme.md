## my history


I was born on 24th January 1996.  
My **academical** career started at the _Eichendorff-Grundschule_ in Berlin.  
After that I went to the _Wolfgang-Borchert-Oberschule_, also in Berlin, where I did my MSA.    
I did my Abitur at the _Bertholt-Brecht-Oberschule_ in Berlin, which I did in 3 years.  
Once I had my Abitur I tried a couple colleges (TU Berlin, FU Berlin and University of Leipzig), where I attended in Computer Science and Physics lectures.  
Unfortunatly, I didn't like college at all. It was plain boring and I didn't like the way they teach you stuff.  
Right now I'm an intern at **DOCYET** until the 31st July 2019. Once that time is passed,    I'll start my apprenticeship as a software developer at **DOCYET**.  
My main focus is going to be **front end** developing.
